                <p><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></p>
                <p>Your privacy is important to us.</p>
                <p>FotoApps (“FotoApps,” “we,” and “us”) respects the privacy of its users (“you”) and has developed this
                    Privacy Policy to demonstrate its commitment to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy
                    describes the information we collect, how that information may be used, with whom it may be shared,
                    and your choices about such uses and disclosures. We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy
                    carefully when using our application or services or transacting business with us. By using our
                    applications (our “Service”), you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
                <p>If you have any questions about our privacy practices, please refer to the end of this Privacy
                    Policy for information on how to contact us.</p>
                <p><strong>Personal Information</strong> <br> We DO NOT collect, store or use any personal information
                    while you visit, download or upgrade our products. <br> We may use personal information submitted
                    by you only for the following purposes: help us develop, deliver, and improve our products and
                    services and supply higher quality service; manage online surveys and other activities you’ve
                    participated in. <br> In the following circumstances, we may disclose your personal information
                    according to your wish or regulations by law:</p>
                <p>&nbsp; (1) Your prior permission;</p>
                <p>&nbsp; (2) By the applicable law within or outside your country of residence, legal process,
                    litigation requests;</p>
                <p>&nbsp; (3) By requests from public and governmental authorities;</p>
                <p>&nbsp; (4) To protect our legal rights and interests. <br> <br> <strong>Non- Personal Information</strong>
                    <br> We may collect and use non-personal information in the following circumstances. To have a
                    better understanding in user’s behavior, solve problems in products and services, improve our
                    products, services and advertising, we may collect non-personal information such as installed
                    application name and package name, the data of install, frequency of use, country, equipment and
                    channel. <br> If non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the
                    combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.</p>
                <p><strong>Information we get from your use of our services</strong> <br> We may collect information
                    about the services that you use and how you use them, such as when you view and interact with our
                    content. We may collect device-specific information (such as your hardware model, operating system
                    version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information). FotoApps will not share that
                    information with third parties. <br> <br> <strong>Location information </strong><br> When you use a
                    location-enabled Fotoable service, we may collect and process information about your actual
                    location, like GPS signals sent by a mobile device. We may also use various technologies to
                    determine location, such as sensor data from your device that may, for example, provide information
                    on nearby Wi-Fi access points and cell towers.</p>
                <p class="p13"><strong>Information collected by </strong><strong>third-parties for advertising purposes
                    </strong></p>
                <p class="p13">We may allow service providers, advertising companies and ad networks, and other third
                    parties to display advertisements on our Service. These companies may use tracking technologies,
                    such as cookies or web beacons, to collect information about users who view or interact with their
                    advertisements. We do not provide any non-anonymized personal information to third parties.<br> <br>
                    <strong>Unique application numbers</strong> <br> Certain services include a unique application
                    number. This number and information about your installation (for example, the operating system type
                    and application version number) may be sent to our servers when you install or uninstall that
                    service or when that service periodically contacts our servers, such as for automatic updates. <br>
                    <br> FotoApps will occasionally update this privacy statement. When we do so, we will also revise
                    the "last modified" date of the privacy statement.</p>
